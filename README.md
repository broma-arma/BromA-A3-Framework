*After a lot of very difficult and sanity bending work, it is finally finished: the project has reached a satisfactory state and is now ready for public use*.

# What is the [BromA](http://broma.co.uk) Mission Framework?

The *BromA Mission Framework* (referred to from now on as "BMF") is simply put a collection of scripts - most made in-house, some adapted - designed to function together, bringing essential functions to ArmA missions with minimal effort on part of the mission maker, regardless of past experience or level of scripting expertise.
While the BMF is designed to include the vast majority of common features, mission makers are invited to customize and disable modules as desired, with many modules included as session-unique Parameters for an increased replayability factor.

**Perks of the BMF include but not limited to:**

* Designed for concision and practicality
* Preset and easy to alter parameters
* Easily manageable tasks
* Intuitive loadout system
* Fully integrated with AGM
* Team Roster
* AI management with DAC integration
* Time Limit
* Limit for civilian casualties
* Customizable ending screens
* Spawn protection

... and **much** more.

# Usage and application

The BMF is designed first and foremost with simplicity and cohesion in mind: in order to make a regular Destroy and Capture mission, the user will only need to customize his own parameters and place the AI zones wherever desired and adjust the player units with gear - the underlying work is already finished and tested.

Using the BMF is very simple:


* Download the lastest version from this git repository.
* Create a folder named "**yourname_gamemode_playercount_missionname_vernumber**.desert_e" to your default missions folder, generally located at ```Documents\ArmA 3 Other Profiles\YourUserName\Missions```
* Example: ```nife_tvt_30_thefinalstand_v08``` ```royal_co_30_redmile_v12```
* If you wish to use another map, [refer to this guide](http://ferstaberinde.com/f2/en/index.php?title=Using_F2_with_other_islands).
* Start customizing your mission.

Further and proper documentation is already underway, but for now you can watch the [entire process from a recorded live stream](http://www.twitch.tv/neefay/b/539959948)

Here are some resources you can use if you get stuck:

* [DAC Documentation](https://www.mediafire.com/?h4j8g2hjqa9opog)
* [Taskmaster](http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?100731-Taskmaster-2)
* [All ArmA Scripting Commands](http://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Scripting_Commands_by_Functionality)

I really really really really recommend you use the [SQF Editor](http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=14714) to edit your missions; it has an built-in synthax check and command lookup for all of ArmA's variables and functions, which proves to be invaluable.

# Credits and acknowledgements

As stated previously, the BMF is a compilation - a mashup of several different scripts and modules - modified and adapted to function together without any conflicts. Naturally, it is  imperative to recognize the absolutely amazing work of the authors of these scripts.
